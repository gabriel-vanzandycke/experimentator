goals:
- allow multi input, multi output model arguments
- plug and play GPU operators instead of a fixed flow to create model (@maxime)
- modular implementation (callbacks, GPU operators, dataset transformations) such that common objects/functions can be shared and specific objects/functions are grouped per task (@maxime)
- single python object through which all parameters/configuration can be read or modified (@maxime)
-
